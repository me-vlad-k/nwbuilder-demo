# nwbuilder-demo

I've decided to create a demo project for nw-builder to test and demonstrate its functionality. The documentation is quite vague, and I'm personally struggling to get started, so having a fully functional demo would really help connect the dots.

# Version of nw-builder 4.9.0

I've tested several versions and found that 4.9.0 is the most reliable. It's the only one that allowed me to successfully build for the ARM64 architecture.
